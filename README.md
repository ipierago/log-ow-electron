This is the simplest possible implementation of an app using the ow-electron library. It listens for all events and info updates and logs them.

## Setup

Before running for the first time, execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

To run the app, execute the following command.

```bash
npm start
```

The "start" script in packages.json includes the command line switch to use the qa/development build of the game events package (gep).
